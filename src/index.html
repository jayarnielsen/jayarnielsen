      As co-creator of Dototot and co-producer of The Hello World Program, I educate and empower people to make their own media and engage critically with contemporary advances in technology. I graduated from Utah Valley University in 2009 with a BS in Digital Media and have extensive web development and video production experience reaching back to 2008. As a proponent of open-source technology, most of my creative works are produced on Linux-based machines using free and open-source software.
